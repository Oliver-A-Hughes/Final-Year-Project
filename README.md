E-Cover: Application to fill vacancies in retail stores.


Whenever a member of staff at a retail store reportes sick or unavailable for work, HR and managers can spend a significant amount of time phoning other members of staff seeking a replacement. However, this is a time consuming and costly process that does not provide a productive use of HR or managers’ time. This can come at short notice which is particularly critical for the smaller retail stores which frequently operate with only one or two staff members on any shift. Therefore, if a replacement member of staff cannot be found the store may have to close with a loss of sales and profit and potential great annoyance and inconvenience to the customers.

For my final year project, I decided to build a solution to this problem called E-Cover. E-Cover is a web application that provides an instant and efficient service for contacting all staff members within the vicinity of a store. HR/Area managers can login to E-Cover to create notice that a position needs filled. E-Cover will then send sms-messages to the mobile phones of staff members to check their availability. E-Cover facilitates a staff response to the messages which will then allow HR/area managers to fill the vacant position on a “first come, first serve” basis. Once the position has been filled the system will notify all other staff previously contacted to advise, thus preventing unnecessary responses.
